# Digital Image Processing Project: Restoration of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's Image
Welcome to the Digital Image Processing project focused on restoring an old image of the Indian king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. In this project, we employ various image processing techniques to enhance and restore the historical image.

The goal of this project is to employ various image processing methods to address common challenges faced by historical images, such as noise, marks, and fading. We begin by adding and removing salt-and-pepper noise to simulate the effects of aging. Subsequently, we explore the process of inpainting to selectively restore specific regions of the image. To add a touch of vibrancy, we integrate DeOldify, a powerful deep learning model for colorization, to bring the restored image to life.
